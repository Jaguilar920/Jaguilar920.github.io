In the project, I first started with a game idea to push random enemies then moved on to a more pvp oriented setup.

I started with setting up character creation, though a limited variant based on DND

I used a table to organize skills and proficiencies.

I added armor.

I Then worked on functions to connect everything together so that numbers reflect in live feed when you adjust scores.

When i got to the combat portion there were a lot of numbers i could not figure out how to grab from a string. This lead to a huge setback.

I may have to redo the table to divs and an array to grab character values instead.
